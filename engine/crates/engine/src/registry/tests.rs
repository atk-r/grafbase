            This test ensures the default `VersionedRegistry` serialization output remains stable.

            When this test fails, it likely means the shape of the `Registry` type was updated,
            which can cause backward-incompatibility issues.

            Before updating this test to match the expected result, please ensure the changes to
            `Registry` are applied in a backward compatible way.

            One way to do so, is to have the `Default` trait return a value that keeps the existing
            expectation, and `#[serde(default)]` is applied to any newly added field.

            Once you are satisfied your changes are backward-compatible, update `EXPECTED_SHA` with
            the new output presented in the test result.
